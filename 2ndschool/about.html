<h1>About Us</h1><p>Reimagining Education. Reaching Every Kid.
At 2nd School, we believe that quality education shouldn‚Äôt depend on a zip code. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre taking learning on the road‚Äîand into gardens, neighborhoods, and community centers‚Äîto bring curiosity, science, and discovery straight to the kids who need it most.
Founded on the belief that every child deserves access to hands-on, meaningful learning experiences, 2nd School is a grassroots initiative delivering mobile, community-powered education to lower-income communities. Our programs are designed to inspire, empower, and connect‚Äîremoving barriers and opening doors for the next generation of scientists, problem-solvers, and changemakers.

<h2>What We Do</h2><p>üöç Science Buses
    We‚Äôve converted buses into fully-equipped mobile classrooms, bringing interactive science labs and experiments right to underserved neighborhoods. Kids step inside and step into a world of discovery‚Äîfrom chemistry to robotics to environmental science.
    <br>
    <br>
    üå± Community Garden Setups
    We help communities build and sustain educational gardens that serve as living classrooms. These spaces teach everything from biology to sustainability, while also promoting food justice, teamwork, and a love of nature.
    <br>
    <br>
    üß≠ Traveling Instructors
    Our team of educators don't wait for kids to come to school‚Äîwe bring the school to them. Whether it's a park, a shelter, or a community center, our instructors meet students where they are with engaging lessons that spark curiosity and confidence.
