<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <def><b>sous vide</b></def>. In <b>sous vide</b> cooking, you submerge the food <i>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</i> into a water bath that is <i>precisely</i> set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30.</time></p>
